reorganize either bin/H or its subcmds to be more project-centric; either that, or make a binstub for each 'project' (see examples below)

so here is a set of actions, basically a use case
demonstrating how multiple tools will work together to give
the developer a simple user experience:

```
# hero project add [project-name] [project-path]

$> hero project add hiro ~/repos/hero-project

  Adding a new project to $HOME/hero/projects.yml...
    name: 'hiro'
    path: '/Users/unixsuperhero/repos/hero-project'

    Generating binstub...
      Saving to =>
        $HOME/hero/bin/hiro
        $HOME/hero/projects/bin/hiro
    done
  done

$> hiro task save 'release v0.0.1 of the hero project'
$> hiro tmux

  Command: tmux new -s hiro -c $HOME/repos/hero-project

$>
```

#hero/h #hero/todo #todo/hero
