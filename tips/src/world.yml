      favor hardlinks over symlinks, when possible.  for example, a symlink can break
      for any number of reasons, not only is it harder to break a hardlink, but its
      content is tracked in git like a normal file.

      imagine a simple git repo that contains 2 links to a file, a symlink and a
      hardlink.  the original file that they both link to is not tracked by the git
      repo, because it is located in a different folder.  if someone using a different
      computer clones the repo and the original file doesn't exist, the hardlink will
      still be identical to the original file, but the symlink will be broken.
