      favor hardlinks over symlinks, when possible.  for example, a symlink can break
      for any number of reasons, not only is it harder to break a hardlink, but its
      content is tracked in git like a normal file.

      imagine a simple git repo that contains 2 links to a file, a symlink and a
      hardlink.  the original file that they both link to is not tracked by the git
      repo, because it is located in a different folder.  if someone using a different
      computer clones the repo and the original file doesn't exist, the hardlink will
      still be identical to the original file, but the symlink will be broken.

      ignore or include hidden files when running a cmd on "everything"

      the difference between passing `.` and `*` to a command when you want to
      indicate the current directory

      * `.` will usually include dotfiles, since they exist in the current directory
      * `*`, on the other hand, will match all non-hidden files in the pwd.  if you
        are in a situation where you want to stick with `*`, but also want dotfiles
        included in the arg list, add `.*` like this: `* .*`.

      using symbolic-ref to make branch aliases is great because...

      1. it lets you access common branches with few keystrokes
      2. lets you have naming conventions to improve your workflow
      3. great for typing short checkout, cherry, cherry-pick, diff, etc. commands

      # Convention Example

      Whenever starting a feature branch, alias it as `feat`.
      Alias the branches that mirror remotes, with shorter names. `qa`, etc.
