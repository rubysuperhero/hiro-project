delete file using its inode number

sometimes a file is named in a way that it is hard to delete using the normal
command-line.  to delete it, first find it's inode number, then use find to run
rm on it.

```
ls -il   # the first column is the inode number

find . -inum "$INODE_GOES_HERE" -exec rm -i \{\} \;

```

#unix #unix/rm #files
