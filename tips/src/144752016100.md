conveniently access functions in #vim using abbreviations and/or commands

For example, I wrote a function that looks through v:oldfiles for a search
pattern and opens the matches.  I gave the function some long, descriptive name,
but I named the commands and abbreviations like this:

```
command! -nargs=+ VsOldfile call VsplitMatchingOldfilePartialFilename(<f-args>)
cabbrev vf VsOldfile
```

This way, all I have to do is type `:vf<space>` and it expands into
`:VsOldFile<space>` which will call my function when given a search pattern.
