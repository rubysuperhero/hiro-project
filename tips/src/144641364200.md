favor hardlinks over symlinks, when possible.  for example, a symlink can break
for any number of reasons, not only is it harder to break a hardlink, but its
content is tracked in git like a normal file.

imagine a simple git repo that contains 2 links to a file, a symlink and a
hardlink.  the original file that they both link to is not tracked by the git
repo, because it is located in a different folder.  if someone using a different
computer clones the repo and the original file doesn't exist, the hardlink will
still be identical to the original file, but the symlink will be broken.

#bash #git #symlink #hardlink #files
