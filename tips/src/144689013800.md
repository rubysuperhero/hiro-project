using symbolic-ref to make branch aliases is great because...

1. it lets you access common branches with few keystrokes
2. lets you have naming conventions to improve your workflow
3. great for typing short checkout, cherry, cherry-pick, diff, etc. commands

# Convention Example

Whenever starting a feature branch, alias it as `feat`.
Alias the branches that mirror remotes, with shorter names. `qa`, etc.

#git #git/branch #git/symbolic-ref
